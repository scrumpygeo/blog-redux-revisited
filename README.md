## React-Redux Blog

Simple CRUD react redux app using existing heroku blog backend.

1. Setup

Using `http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/api/posts` api for blogs which has these fields:

```

title
categories
content



This api doesn't allow put or patch.
However as this front end will later be used with a custom rails api I will leave the functionality in.
```
